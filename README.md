**HydroMind** is an advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline and industrial SCADA dashboard designed to autonomously manage municipal water distribution networks.

By replacing static, manual valves with a **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** agent, HydroMind maps physical pipe topology into **PyTorch Geometric Graph Tensors** to optimize flow rates, maintain target tail-end pressures, and instantly isolate network anomalies like pipe bursts.

# 🏗️ Core Architecture

The system bridges the gap between complex fluid dynamics and edge-deployed machine learning:

### 1️⃣ The Physics Engine (EPANET / WNTR)
Simulates the hydraulic behavior of the **800+ node L-Town network**, calculating live head loss, friction, and pressure.

### 2️⃣ The Graph Neural Network (GNN)
Ingests live IoT sensor data (elevation, demand, pressure) and constructs a mathematical **state tensor** of the current network.

### 3️⃣ The DDPG Actor-Critic Agent
Trained over hundreds of episodes to satisfy the **Bellman equation**, the Actor network runs a forward pass to compute the optimal, continuous control action for the main distribution valve.

### 4️⃣ The SCADA Digital Twin
A high-performance **Streamlit frontend** that translates the PyTorch tensor outputs into a human-readable, industrial command terminal.

# 🌊 System Process Flow

HydroMind operates in real-time, executing the following control loop during a network crisis:

### 1️⃣ Baseline Operation
Under normal conditions, the DDPG agent maintains the main distribution valve at an optimized baseline (e.g., **46.1%**) to perfectly hold the tail-end node pressure at a **20.0m target**.

### 2️⃣ Crisis Detection
A simulated anomaly (such as a massive pipe burst in **District Metered Area 2**) causes an immediate downstream pressure drop and spikes **Non-Revenue Water Loss**.

### 3️⃣ Graph Spatial Analysis
The anomaly is ingested as a **PyTorch Graph Tensor**. The Graph Neural Network immediately flags the spatial correlation between the pressure drop and upstream nodes.

### 4️⃣ AI Inference & Actuation
The Actor network computes a gradient ascent to maximize the downstream **Q-value**, calculating a new optimal valve aperture (e.g., **78.4%**).

### 5️⃣ Hardware Sync
A simulated **Modbus TCP command** is transmitted to the PLC, actuating the physical valve, isolating the leak, and stabilizing the municipal grid **without human intervention**.
